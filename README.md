We present a language model that replaces conventional subword tokenization with a dual representation of text as 
both bytes and rendered images of "words", allowing the model to directly process the visual and symbolic 
structure of language. It segments text into whitespace-delimited units, encodes each as images and byte sequences, 
and passes them through an encoder–decoder pipeline: 
a bytes encoder, an image encoder, a large latent transformer, and a bytes decoder. 
At inference, predicted bytes are rendered back into images, closing the loop for the next prediction.
This design could make learning and inference cheaper and faster for non-English languages, 
since the heavy latent transformer only predicts high-level token representations while the actual byte 
sequences are generated by a much smaller decoder.

## Quick Start

Clone and setup:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sign/WeLT.git
cd WeLT
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
conda create -n welt python=3.12 -y
conda activate welt
conda install -c conda-forge pycairo pygobject manimpango -y
pip install ".[dev]"
```

Or using docker:

```shell
docker build -t welt .
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/welt:/app/welt" \
  -v "$(pwd)/training:/app/training" \
  welt /bin/bash
```

> [!TIP]
> Run tests using `pytest` to ensure everything is working correctly.

## Model Setup

- **Bytes Encoder** - You can use any language model as the bytes encoder (causal or masked).
- **Image Encoder** - You can use any image encoder.
- **Latent Transformer** - You can use any causal LM (recommended: large).
- **Bytes Decoder** - You can use any causal LM (recommended: small).

For language models, the parameter count is lower than reported, due to removing the embedding layers.

Our implementation allows for any mix-and-match. Some example setups are:

| Name   | Bytes Encoder                                                                | Image Encoder                                                                                             | Latent Transformer                                                    | Bytes Decoder                                                             | Total Parameters |

To turn off bytes encoding, set `bytes_encoder=False`, and similarly for images, set `image_encoder=False`.
You can also turn off a specific encoder after training has completed, for testing purposes.

> [!WARNING]  
> In implementation of the bytes decoder, we concatenate the embeddings of the bytes of the current token with
> all the embeddings of the previous tokens (on the word level). This is done since not all causal LMs support
> cross-attention, and so we want to avoid using it, and rely on the self-attention mechanism instead.

## Training

Training instructions are available in the [training/README.md](./training/README.md).
There, you can select the model architectures you want to use for each component, and the dataset you want to train on.

## Inference

> [!CAUTION]
> Our text [renderer](./welt/renderer.py) relies on the computer's font rendering capabilities.
> Rendering on different systems may yield different results (e.g. emoji).
> We call the community to create a more robust renderer, decoupled from the system's font rendering,
> for better consistency across platforms and easier reproducibility.

Since we have two decoders, the autoregressive prediction logic is a bit more complex than the usual,
and supporting decoding algorithms like beam-search is not trivial.

Thus, on the latent-transformer level,
[we only support greedy decoding](https://github.com/sign/WeLT/issues/5) for now.
On the bytes decoder level, we support all classical decoding algorithms supported by HuggingFace Transformers.
